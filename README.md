## About The Project

Provide a more detailed explanation of what your project does, its goals, and why it was created. Include any key features or functionalities.

### Built With

List the major frameworks/libraries/technologies used in your project.
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* imbalanced-learn

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. This project also requires several Python libraries which can be installed via pip.

*   pip

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd your_project
    ```
3.  Install Python packages
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib imbalanced-learn joblib
    ```
4.  Place your `heart.csv` dataset and `model.pkl` file in the project root directory.

## Usage

Describe how to use your project. For example:

To run the analysis and model evaluation:

```python
# Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
# your_notebook_name.ipynb
```

This will load the data, split it, load the pre-trained model, make predictions, calculate accuracy, and display a confusion matrix and accuracy graph. It also includes steps for data balancing using SMOTE and re-evaluating the model's performance with new metrics.
